When we had our first kid, my wife and I read a number of books to figure out what we were doing. For sleep training, we landed on *[On Becoming Baby Wise](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Baby-Wise-Giving-Nighttime-ebook/dp/B00CLKEUVM)* to figure out the sleep training. The book laid out a number of templates in grid form and left you to figure out what worked the best for your baby. It was useful, but difficult to interpret, expecially for sleep deprived parents. 

To improve the readability of the data, I converted the tables into visualizing to pin up on our fridge and outside the baby's room. 

Tools
   - Pen and paper: mock up image and layouts
   - Excel: expand examples into full time tables with categories
   - Adobe Illustrator: design mock ups and final outputs
