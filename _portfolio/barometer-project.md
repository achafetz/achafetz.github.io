*External Contract Project*

## Project Purpose
Design an all inclusive planning and assesment tool for a non-profit's data needs during humanitarian emergencies. 

## Overview
  - The tool needed to be available offline and not install new software, so I developed a multi-purpose tool in Excel, serving as a vehicle for survey collection/capture, database for storing survey results, and interface for dynamically interacting with survey results. 
  - The tool was used by surveyors to enter and record two different types of surveys from respondents in different countries and then show weighted results via a composite index score from that survey or multiple/all if the outputs were combined together as well. 
  - I relied heavily on VBA to design the collection/submission side as well as navigation and updating the dashboard data. A lot of though went into how to structure the data to allow for reviewers in countries and eventually at headquarters to analyze the data across different criteria and categories.

## Lessons Learned
   - Requirements gathering
   - Working with external stakeholders
   - Designing forms within Excel for data capture
