I worked with a non-profit to design an all inclusivee planning and assesment tool for their data needs during humanitarian emergencies. The tool needed to be available offline and not install new software, so I developed a multi-purpose tool in Excel, serving as a vehicle for survey collection/capture, database for storing survey results, and interface for dynamically interacting with survey results. 

The tool was used by surveyors to enter and record two different types of surveys from respondents in different countries and then show weighted results via a composite index score from that survey or multiple/all if the outputs were combined together as well. I relied heavily on VBA to design the collection/submission side as well as navigation and updating the dashboard data. A lot of though went into how to structure the data to allow for reviewers in countries and eventually at headquarters to analyze the data across different criteria and categories.

Tools
   - Pen and paper: mock up image and layouts
   - Excel + VBA: data entry, VBA scripts, "data base", and data viz/dashboard
