Training for an Ironman race is no easy feat. Triathletes have to train across 3 different diciplines and typically do so over many, many months in order to do an all day race that conists of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile run. In training for my race, I logged all of my training via a smart watch, which allowed me to track my exertion, training load, and distances. After the race was complete, I went back and requested all of my training data to download so I could showing all of my training and race activies over the course of the year, visualizing my accomplishment by more than just what was achieved on race day.

Tools
   - Pen and paper: mock up image and layouts
   - R: data munging and visualization
