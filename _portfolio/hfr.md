## Project Purpose
Envision and design a system to collect, process, and analyze facility-based data from 50 countries datasets on a monthly. High Frequency Reporting (HFR) was intented to be used as an early-warning system that provided important signals about areas that could be changed or adapted to increase impact to achieve targets and results. 

## Overview

  -  USAID initiated HFR in 2019 after one Opertiang Unit demonstrated how using weekly site-level data provided an early warning for service delivery course corrections in advance of MER data. 
  - Within three months, we established the systematic collection and use of these data and worked with OAA to mandate reporting from implementing partners (IPs) based on a subset of MER indicators. 
  - USAID leveraged HFR to expand multi-month dispencing (MMD), sustaining treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. 


## Outcomes
  - Designed a standardized Excel based template to collect monthly facility-based data across 50 countries, comprising of more than 10,000 sites and communities
  - Designed an R package to valiate and process submitted reports
  - Designed APIs to pull in PEPFAR meta data
  - Designed Tableau dashboards for monthly tracking 
  - Generated error reports for users relying on markdown 


## Lessons Learned
  - Worked with M/CIO to white list the Google API
  - Deisgned APIs to pull in meta data
  - Utilized Google Forms to systematize the collection of files and use automate a data pipeline
  - Create a use case/demand for a server to house the HFR data
  - Pilot the Development Data Commons, working with an implementing partner and M/CIO to develop a data lake and data enterprise solution
  - Importance of feedback and information exchanges from country missions and Washington office leadership
  - Establishing use cases and defining success criteria
