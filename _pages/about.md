I'm Aaron Chafetz and am a Senior Economist at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in the Office of HIV/AIDS, where I specialize in quantitative analysis of global health data. Most of my work is concentrated in analyzing large quantities of data from health facilities and communities around the world, identifying indicator trends and outliers to inform data drive decision making within the interagency space of PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

I works with a small team of data scientists and analysts (@USAID-OHA-SI), helping to advance analytics, tools, and communication both at headquarters and the field. Working closely with @tessam30, @baboyma, @jaliasd, @karishmas26, and @n-petrovic, we've developed a number of R packages for working with PEPFAR data using R, all strongly built off the tidyverse and grounded in principles of reproducibility, transparency and accountability. We've designed a R build blocks series based on R for Data Science, but geared towards our headquarters- and mission-base using PEPFAR data and workflows

I'm passionate about data viz and share thoughts and inspiration with my teammates in a series called Monday Data Viz and through our office's data viz style guide, co-developed with @tessam30.
