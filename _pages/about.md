I'm Aaron Chafetz and am a Senior Economist at the [U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)](https://www.usaid.gov/) in the [Office of HIV/AIDS](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/hiv-and-aids), where I specialize in quantitative analysis of global health data. Most of my work is concentrated in analyzing large quantities of data from health facilities and communities around the world, identifying indicator trends and outliers, to inform data drive decision making for leadership and stakeholders within USAID and the interagency space of [PEPFAR](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/), the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

Throughout my tenure, my work has largely centered on analyzing large data, designing open source R packages to improve and automate data workflows and pipelines, managing data and data collection processes, advocating with our CIO to get the tools in the tech stack that we need, piloting AI to leverage LLM where it makes sense, and heavily applying and teaching data visualization skills plus UI/UX to better communicate data to leadership and stakeholders.

I works closely with a small team of data scientists and analysts ([@USAID-OHA-SI](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI)), helping to advance analytics, tools, capacity strenghting, and communication both at headquarters and across our missions. My colleagues and I have developed and maintain over ten [open source R packages](https://usaid-oha-si.r-universe.dev/packages) to improve processes and workflows for working with PEPFAR and other HIV data using R, all strongly built off the tidyverse and grounded in principles of reproducibility, transparency and accountability. We've designed a R build blocks series based on R for Data Science as well as put on various traininings, but geared towards our headquarters- and mission-base using PEPFAR data and workflows

I'm passionate about data viz and share thoughts and inspiration with my teammates in a series called Monday Data Viz and through our office's [data viz style guide](https://issuu.com/achafetz/docs/oha_styleguide), co-developed with Tim Essam and later updated with the help of Amanda Mukulec and Karishma Srikanth.

All of my public code can be found on GitHub, on [my account](https://github.com/achafetz), but largely on [our team's organizational account](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI).
